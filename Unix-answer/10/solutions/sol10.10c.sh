# Version c: Only report on if a user is logged in regardless of
#	     the number of times.
#            Solution: use cut, sort -u
# Version b: Only produce output if there is something to show in
#            that category
#	     Solution: write output to a temp file.  Then use test -s
#	     to check if temp file has non-zero size
#
# Version a: Accept a list of users to watch.  The name of the
#            file with that list is a command line arg.
#
# note: the list of users has to have one name per line
